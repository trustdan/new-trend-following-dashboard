# Alt22 - Parabolic SAR

## ⭐ QQQ & Tech Momentum Specialist

---

## 📊 Quick Stats

**QQQ Performance:** Excellent (momentum specialist)

**Options Suitability:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Good (Tech only)

**Hold Time:** 2-6 weeks

**Best For:** QQQ, tech breakouts, high momentum

**Trade Frequency:** High churn (frequent trades)

**AVOID:** Healthcare, utilities, defensive sectors

---

## 🎯 What This Strategy Does

Alt22 uses the **Parabolic SAR indicator** for entries and exits:

- **Entry:** When price crosses above Parabolic SAR
- **Exit:** When price crosses below Parabolic SAR
- **Fast-moving:** High frequency, momentum-chasing
- **Trend-following:** Captures explosive moves

### The Parabolic SAR:
Dots that follow price, accelerating with momentum:
- **Dots below price** = Uptrend (long signal)
- **Dots above price** = Downtrend (exit signal)
- **Acceleration factor** increases as trend continues

### High Churn Strategy:
Expect 15-25 trades per year (vs 5-10 for other strategies). More commissions but catches momentum moves.

## ❌ AVOID These Sectors

| Sector | Why to Avoid |
|--------|--------------|
| **Healthcare** | Defensive sector, slow grinding (whipsaws) |
| **Utilities** | Mean-reverting, catastrophic losses |
| **Energy** | Choppy, generates false signals |
| **Real Estate** | Low volatility, excessive whipsaws |

**Key Insight:** Parabolic SAR underperforms on defensive/slow-moving sectors

---

## 📈 Options Trading Compatibility

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐ GOOD for Tech Options

**Why It Works on Tech:**
- 2-6 week hold = 30-45 DTE options
- Fast momentum moves captured
- QQQ = high liquidity options
- Tech volatility = profitable moves

### ⚠️ Cautions:
- High churn = frequent position changes
- Commission costs add up
- Requires active management
- Not suitable for patient holders

### Options Strategy Examples:

**QQQ Long Call (Momentum):**
1. Buy calls when price crosses above SAR (30-45 DTE)
2. Hold while SAR stays below price
3. Exit when price crosses below SAR
4. Expect 2-6 week holds on average

**Tech Stock Bull Call Spread (GOOGL):**
1. Enter spread on SAR crossover
2. Momentum move captured in 2-4 weeks
3. Exit on SAR reversal signal
4. Roll to new spread if momentum continues

## 🎓 How to Use in TradingView

1. **Apply to QQQ or tech momentum stock**
2. **Wait for Parabolic SAR crossover:**
   - **Long Entry:** Price crosses ABOVE SAR dots
   - **Exit:** Price crosses BELOW SAR dots
3. **No profit targets** - Exit on indicator reversal only
4. **Fast execution** - Momentum moves require speed

### Critical Rules:
- ✅ Only use on tech/momentum securities
- ✅ Exit immediately on SAR reversal
- ✅ Accept high trade frequency
- ❌ Don't use on defensive sectors
- ❌ Don't override exits (SAR reversal = exit)

## 🔬 Parabolic SAR Logic

### How the Indicator Works:

**SAR (Stop and Reverse):**
```
Initial AF (Acceleration Factor) = 0.02
Maximum AF = 0.20
AF increases by 0.02 each period new extreme reached
```

**Uptrend:**
```
SAR dots below price
AF accelerates as trend continues
Reversal when price touches/crosses SAR
```

**Downtrend:**
```
SAR dots above price (exit signal for longs)
AF resets on reversal
Re-enter when price crosses back above SAR
```

### Example Trade (QQQ):

1. **Day 1:** Price $400, SAR $390 → Long signal
2. **Day 1-30:** SAR trails below price ($392, $394, $396...)
3. **Day 31:** Price drops to $405, SAR at $402 → Exit signal
4. **Result:** 30-day momentum trade captured, exit on reversal
