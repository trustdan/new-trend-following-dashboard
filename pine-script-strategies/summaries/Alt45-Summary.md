# Alt45 - Dual-Momentum Confirmation

## ⭐ 2nd-Best Consistency - Avoids Weak Breakouts

---

## 📊 Quick Stats

**Consistency:** 2nd-best across 293 backtests

**Options Suitability:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Good (Stocks), ⭐⭐ Weak (SPY)

**Hold Time:** 3-12 weeks

**Best For:** Stocks, QQQ (NOT SPY), quality over quantity

**Trade Philosophy:** Fewer trades, higher quality

---

## 🎯 What This Strategy Does

Alt45 requires **BOTH price momentum AND relative strength** before entry:

1. **Price Momentum** → Stock making new highs (Donchian)
2. **Relative Strength** → Stock outperforming sector/market
3. **Both confirmed** → Enter trade
4. **Either weakens** → Exit trade

### Dual Confirmation Logic:
Unlike other strategies that enter on price breakout alone, Alt45 adds:
- **Is price breaking out?** ✓ (Price momentum)
- **Is stock stronger than peers?** ✓ (Relative strength)
- **Both YES** → High-quality breakout, enter
- **Either NO** → Weak breakout, skip

### Quality Over Quantity:
Expect 8-12 trades per year (vs 10-15 for Alt10). Fewer trades but higher win rate.

- **Individual stocks** (QQQ, XLV, CAT, GOOGL, WMT)
- **Quality filtering** - Avoiding false breakouts

## ❌ Weakness: Underperforms on SPY

| Security | Alt45 Performance | Better Alternative |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **SPY** | Weak (over-filters) | Alt39 or Alt10 |
| **QQQ** | Excellent | Use Alt45 |
| **Individual Stocks** | Excellent | Use Alt45 |
| **XLV** | Good | Alt46 or Alt10 slightly better |

**Key Weakness:** Dual confirmation over-filters on broad market SPY

---

## 📈 Options Trading Compatibility

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐ GOOD for Stock Options

**Why It Works on Stocks:**
- 3-12 week hold = 45-90 DTE sweet spot
- Dual confirmation = higher-quality moves
- Stocks have clear relative strength signals
- Fewer false breakouts = better options value retention

### ⭐⭐ WEAK for SPY Options

**Why SPY Underperforms:**
- Broad market = weak relative strength signals
- Over-filtering misses SPY moves
- Better alternatives: Alt39 or Alt10 for SPY options

### Options Strategy Examples:

**QQQ Long Call (Dual Confirmation):**
1. QQQ breaks Donchian high (price momentum ✓)
2. QQQ outperforming SPY (relative strength ✓)
3. Enter calls with 60-75 DTE
4. Hold while both conditions remain true
5. Exit if either momentum or relative strength weakens

**Individual Stock Bull Call Spread (CAT):**
1. CAT breaks out to new high
2. CAT stronger than XLI (industrials ETF)
3. Both confirmed → Enter spread
4. High-quality breakout captured
5. Fewer whipsaws than Alt10

## 🎓 How to Use in TradingView

1. **Apply to QQQ or individual stock** (not SPY)
2. **Wait for dual confirmation:**
   - **Price Momentum:** Donchian 20-period high
   - **Relative Strength:** Stock > sector ETF strength
3. **Enter when BOTH confirmed** (not just one)
4. **Exit when EITHER weakens:**
   - Price breaks below stop, OR
   - Relative strength turns negative
5. **Fewer trades, higher quality**

### Critical Rules:
- ✅ Require both price AND relative strength
- ✅ Exit if either condition fails
- ✅ Be patient for high-quality setups
- ❌ Don't use on SPY (Alt39 better)
- ❌ Don't lower standards (dual confirmation required)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Dual-Confirmation Philosophy:
- **Quality over quantity** - Fewer but better trades
- **Patience required** - Wait for both signals
- **Higher win rate** - Filters false breakouts
- **Stock-friendly** - Clear relative strength on stocks

### Risk Management:
- Dual confirmation = pre-filtered risk
- Higher win rate = fewer losing trades
- Still use 2% risk per trade
- Exit discipline on either signal failure

### Options-Specific Tips:
- **60-90 DTE optimal** - Matches 3-12 week holds
- **QQQ perfect match** - Clear momentum + rel strength
- **Individual stocks strong** - CAT, GOOGL, WMT
- **Avoid SPY options** - Use Alt39 for SPY instead

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- ❌ Entering on price momentum alone (need both)
- ❌ Using on SPY (weak relative strength signals)
- ❌ Impatience (wait for quality setups)
- ❌ Holding when relative strength weakens (exit)

## 🔬 Dual-Momentum Confirmation Logic

### Momentum Components:

**1. Price Momentum (Donchian Breakout):**
```
Current price > highest price in last 20 periods
Confirms absolute price strength
```

**2. Relative Strength:**
```
Stock performance vs sector ETF:
  QQQ vs SPY
  UNH vs XLV
  CAT vs XLI
  GOOGL vs XLK

Relative Strength = (Stock return / Sector return) - 1
Positive = outperforming, Negative = underperforming
```

**3. Dual Confirmation Required:**
```
Entry requires:
  Price Momentum = TRUE (Donchian high)
  AND
  Relative Strength > 0 (outperforming sector)

Exit if:
  Price Momentum = FALSE (stop loss hit)
  OR
  Relative Strength < 0 (underperforming sector)
```

### Example Trade (CAT):

1. **Day 1:** CAT breaks to new 20-day high (**price momentum ✓**)
2. **Day 1:** CAT +2.5%, XLI +1.5% (**relative strength ✓**)
3. **Entry:** Both confirmed → Enter position
4. **Days 2-40:** Both conditions remain true → Hold
5. **Day 41:** CAT -0.5%, XLI +0.5% (**relative strength ✗**)
6. **Exit:** Relative strength turned negative → Exit position
7. **Result:** 40-day high-quality trade, filtered weak continuation
