## 📈 Options Trading Compatibility

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ EXCELLENT for Options Pyramiding

**Why It's Perfect for Options:**
- 2-8 week hold time = 30-60 DTE options
- Add contracts as profit accumulates
- Fractional sizing limits risk on each add
- Low drawdowns = psychological ease

### Options Strategy Examples:

**SPY Bull Call Spread Pyramid:**
1. **Entry:** Buy 10 spreads on initial breakout (60 DTE)
2. **Add 75%:** Buy 7-8 spreads on next breakout (45 DTE)
3. **Add 50%:** Buy 5 spreads on continued strength (30 DTE)
4. **Add 25%:** Buy 2-3 spreads if mega-trend (30 DTE)
5. **Exit ALL:** Close entire position on stop loss

**Long Call Pyramid (QQQ):**
1. Buy 10 calls on momentum breakout
2. Add 7-8 calls from profits on next leg
3. Add 5 calls if trend accelerates
4. Trail stop on entire position

## 🎓 How to Use in TradingView

1. **Apply to trending security** (SPY, QQQ, or tech stock)
2. **Enter initial position** on Donchian 20-period breakout
3. **Wait for next breakout:**
   - Must be NEW 20-period high
   - Don't add if price is flat
4. **Add 75% of initial size** on second breakout
5. **Continue pyramiding** if trend is strong:
   - 3rd add: 50% of initial
   - 4th add: 25% of initial
6. **Exit ALL positions** on stop loss (don't scale out)

### Critical Rules:
- ✅ Only add on NEW Donchian highs
- ✅ Use profits from earlier adds to fund later adds
- ✅ Exit entire pyramid on stop loss
- ❌ Never add to losing positions
- ❌ Never average down

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Pyramiding Rules:
- **Only pyramid winners** - Never add to losing trades
- **Use profits to fund adds** - Don't risk fresh capital
- **Exit everything together** - Don't try to scale out
- **Requires strong trend** - Weak trends will whipsaw

### Risk Management:
- Initial position: Risk 2% of account
- Each add: Funded from profits (not new risk)
- Total position can reach 2.5× base size
- Stop loss exits ENTIRE pyramid (5-6% total loss max)

### Options-Specific Tips:
- Stagger expirations: Earliest contracts for early adds
- Later adds use profits to buy more time
- QQQ/SPY: Use 30-60 DTE for all legs
- Consider calendar spreads for pyramiding structure

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- ❌ Adding on pullbacks (wait for NEW highs)
- ❌ Averaging down (this is pyramiding UP only)
- ❌ Scaling out on exit (exit all together)
- ❌ Using in choppy markets (needs strong trends)

| Add 1 | 75% | 7-8 | 17-18 | Profits from entry |
| Add 2 | 50% | 5 | 22-23 | Profits from add 1 |
| Add 3 | 25% | 2-3 | 24-26 | Profits from add 2 |

**Final Position:** 24-26 contracts (240-260% of base)
