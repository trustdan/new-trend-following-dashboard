## 🔬 Classic Turtle Trading Logic

### The Four Turtle Rules:

**1. Entry Rule (System 1 - Main System):**
```
Buy when price exceeds 20-day high
(Original: 55-day high)
```

**2. Stop Loss Rule:**
```
Stop at 2N ATR below entry
Trail stop to 2N below highest close
```

**3. Pyramid Rule:**
```
Add unit when price moves 0.5N favorable
Maximum 4 units per position
Each unit risks 2% of account
```

**4. Exit Rule:**
```
Exit when price touches 10-day low
(Original: 20-day low)
Exit all units together
```

### Example Trade (MSFT - Baseline):

1. **Entry:** MSFT breaks $400 (20-day high), ATR = $4
2. **Initial stop:** $392 (entry - 2N = $400 - $8)
3. **Add #1:** Price reaches $402 (0.5N = $2), add unit
4. **Add #2:** Price reaches $404, add another unit
5. **Add #3:** Price reaches $406, add final unit (4 total)
6. **Trail stop:** Moves to $400 (2N below $408 peak)
7. **Exit:** Price touches 10-day low at $403
8. **Result:** 3-week trend captured with pyramiding
